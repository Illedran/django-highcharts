Django Highcharts
=================

Django Highchart will make it easier for you to display highcharts graphs.

Quickstart
==========

Install django-highcharts using pip (we do recommend to do it in a virtualenv).

.. code-block:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/novapost/django-highcharts.git
    cd django-highcharts
    pip install -e ./

To integrate it into a Django project, simply add it to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # some interesting stuff...
        'highcharts',
        # some other stuff...
    ]
